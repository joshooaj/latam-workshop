# PowerShell

## MilestonePSTools Module

The documentation is online at [www.MilestonePSTools.com](https://www.milestonepstools.com)
and the module is published to [Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com).

We have some additional samples available on GitHub at [github.com/MilestoneSystemsInc/PowerShellSamples](https://github.com/MilestoneSystemsInc/PowerShellSamples).

When people ask me for help with a script or how to do something, or when I'm
experimenting with something that is not finished or I haven't had time to find
a place for it in the module, or documentation, I will share github "gists" here:
[gist.github.com/joshooaj](https://gist.github.com/joshooaj)

## Shell-managed XProtect

There is an incomplete "manifesto" for a [shell-managed XProtect](https://shell.webredirect.org/) published on an internal server and
accessible at [shell.webredirect.org](https://shell.webredirect.org/).

You'll need to be on VPN to access the page. I think it does a good job
communicating why I'm passionate about being able to manage our
software from a command-line. In order for Milestone, and our customers, to scale, we need to be able to automate _everything_.

## MilestonePSTools Module

The documentation is online at [www.MilestonePSTools.com](https://www.milestonepstools.com)
and the module is published to [Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com).

We have some additional samples available on GitHub at [github.com/MilestoneSystemsInc/PowerShellSamples](https://github.com/MilestoneSystemsInc/PowerShellSamples).

When people ask me for help with a script or how to do something, or when I'm
experimenting with something that is not finished or I haven't had time to find
a place for it in the module, or documentation, I will share github "gists" here:

# LATAM TechOps Workshop - 2022-12-05

Thank you for having me! This repo will be available for the week and will serve
as an easy way to share notes, URL's, keys, scripts, and anything else we might
need to share.

## Please reach out!

Don't hesitate to reach out to me on Teams - I'll always do my best to make time
to help answer questions or assist with technical escalations!

The technologies we work with are many, and each individual topic can be
endlessly complex. If you have a question about something, I _promise_ you that
there are many others with the same question. Don't be shy to ask a
"dumb question" because there are no dumb questions, only learning
(and teaching!) opportunities!
